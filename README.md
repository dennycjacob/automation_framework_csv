# CSV Comparison Framework - Test Plan

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive test plan for the CSV comparison framework, which aims to ensure that multiple CSV files are accurately compared across multiple scenarios, including structure and data content. This test plan outlines test scenarios to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

## Objectives
- Verify the correctness of data comparison between multiple CSV files.
- Ensure the framework works across a wide range of scenarios.

## Test Environment
- Programming Language: C++
- Tools: C++ Compiler, CSV files as input.
- CSV Files: Multiple files (`file1.csv`, `file2.csv`, `file3.csv`, etc.).

## Prerequisites
- Ensure all CSV files exist in the working directory.
- Files should be in a consistent format (e.g., comma-separated, UTF-8 encoded).
- The user should be able to select which CSV files to compare.

## Test Scenarios

### Test Scenario 1: Header Comparison
**Objective**: Verify that the headers in the selected CSV files are identical.
- **Steps**: Compare the headers of the selected files.
- **Expected Result**: Headers should match exactly across all selected files.

### Test Scenario 2: Row Count Validation
**Objective**: Validate that the number of rows in the selected CSV files is identical.
- **Steps**: Count the number of rows in the selected files.
- **Expected Result**: The row counts should be the same across all selected files.

### Test Scenario 3: Column Count Validation
**Objective**: Validate that the number of columns in the selected CSV files is identical.
- **Steps**: Count the number of columns in each selected file.
- **Expected Result**: The column counts should match across all selected files.

### Test Scenario 4: Cell-by-Cell Data Comparison
**Objective**: Verify that each cell's data matches between the selected files.
- **Steps**: Compare the content of each cell in corresponding rows and columns across all selected files.
- **Expected Result**: All cells should have identical data across all selected files.
